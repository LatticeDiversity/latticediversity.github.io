The Lattice Diversity and Inclusion Committee (LDIC) is a standing committee of the
International Symposium of Lattice Field Theory series charged with improving the
intellectual and social climate at the Lattice conference and more broadly within our
field, responding to issues of harassment and misconduct at the conference, and
promoting a welcoming atmosphere, diversity and inclusion in our field.

This committee's functions include advising the LOCs and IACs for the Lattice
conference series on issues related to all aspects of diversity (including but not
limited to gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation), acceptable and unacceptable
conduct. In consultation with the IAC and LOC, the LDIC maintains a Code of Conduct
to be agreed to by all participants during registration for each instance of the
Lattice conference series, and later produces surveys and reports on the state of the
climate at the lattice conferences and future possible efforts to improve it. The
LDIC also produces surveys and reports on diversity and inclusion efforts in the field
as a whole, periodically presenting these results to the lattice community. In
coordination with the LOC, the LDIC receives, reviews and responds to reports of
unprofessional conduct and harassment at the Lattice conference and in the lattice
community, maintaining records of these incidents.

This committee was formed in 2018 with ten members who are representative of the
field. Whenever possible, the committee membership shall satisfy the following
constraints:
  - Minimum of 3 male and 3 female members,
  - Minimum of 2 members from each from the 3 geographic regions (Europe and the Mediterranean; the Americas; Asia/Oceania),
  - Minimum of 1 member each at the rank of Assistant Professor or equivalent, postdoc level, and  graduate student level.
  - At least 1 member of an underrepresented ethnic group (non-white/caucasian).
