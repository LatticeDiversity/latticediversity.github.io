Tereza got her PhD from NYU in 1996 and is currently an Associate Professor at the University of São Paulo, having previously held postdoc positions at Rome "Tor Vergata" and Bielefed, as well as visiting positions at DESY-Zeuthen and LPT Orsay. Her involvement with gender-inequality & diversity issues (e.g. promoting the creation of a female student organization at her institute) is relatively recent, but heartfelt.
