Will completed his PhD at the University of Adelaide in Australia before moving to the US as a postdoc and is now a faculty member at MIT. As a member of the International Advisory Committee of the 2019 International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory, he instigated the formation of this committee on diversity and inclusion. He has chaired the committee from its inception. He is hoping our community can move towards an environment where all people interested in lattice field theory are treated fairly and respectfully and feel welcome.
