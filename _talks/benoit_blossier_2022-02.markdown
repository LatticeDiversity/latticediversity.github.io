Our societies suggest that taking into account gender, diversity and disability is a marker of progress.
Conversely, they are much less tolerant of discriminatory elements that would be explicit, of course,
but also implicit: the latter rejection is conceptual, at least. In Western countries that trend started
in the 70s. As far as people with disabilities are concerned, a milestone has been the vote of a
convention to guarantee their rights by the United Nations in 2006. The academic field, including
science, follows the same trend.

In my presentation I will discuss what favors the inclusion of students with disabilities from the legislation 
and from the universities themselves. Making suitable work environment for researchers with disabilities 
all along their career is a subject still in progress. The very weak number of concerned people explains 
why one is collecting and sharing individual experiences, which is a crucial phase of the process. 
Sometimes they lead to technical-like recommendations that are easy to implement. I will emphasize a 
couple of them that can be applied to the specific research domain of lattice field theory.
